# Community Detection Algorithm

Community detection algorithms are used to identify cohesive groups or communities within complex networks. These algorithms analyze the structural properties of networks to uncover patterns of connectivity and group nodes with similar characteristics. 

Here's a summary of some common community detection algorithms:
Girvan-Newman Algorithm: This algorithm iteratively removes edges with high betweenness centrality to break the network into communities.
Louvain Method: The Louvain method is a greedy optimization algorithm that maximizes modularity. It iteratively merges nodes to improve the modularity score.
Infomap: The Infomap algorithm utilizes information theory to uncover communities by minimizing the expected description length of random walks on the network.
Label Propagation Algorithm: This algorithm assigns labels to nodes based on the majority label of their neighbors and iteratively propagates the labels until convergence.
Spectral Clustering: Spectral clustering leverages the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a graph's Laplacian matrix to partition nodes into communities based on their spectral properties.
Walktrap Algorithm: The Walktrap algorithm measures the similarity between nodes based on random walks and detects communities by applying agglomerative clustering.
Fast Greedy Algorithm: The Fast Greedy algorithm is a hierarchical agglomerative algorithm that optimizes modularity by greedily merging communities.
Edge Betweenness Algorithm: The Edge Betweenness algorithm identifies communities by iteratively removing edges with the highest betweenness centrality.
Link Community Detection: Link Community Detection algorithms focus on identifying overlapping communities by partitioning the network based on the similarity of node neighborhoods.
Clique Percolation Method: The Clique Percolation Method finds overlapping communities by detecting overlapping k-cliques and their connections.
